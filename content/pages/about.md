I'm a visiting student at Samuel Gershman's lab at Harvard, working on simulating human-like induction in an AI that learns to play video games. I am also pursuing a Master's in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at École Polytechnique.

I'm interested in the feedback loop between artificial intelligence and cognitive science: namely how bettering our understanding of the brain can help us design better AI algorithms and vice-versa.
