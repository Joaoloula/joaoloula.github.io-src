Summary: It turns out not all elementary particles are created equal. While at macroscopic scale two bodies can never occupy the same space at the same time, the analogous question at the quantum level, i.e. whether two particles can have the same state at a given moment, is much more subtle and divides all particles into two categories -- bosons and fermions (named respectively after physicists Satyendra Bose and Enrico Fermi).
