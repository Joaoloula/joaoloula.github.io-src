I'm a Master's student at École Polytechnique de Paris, studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I was recently an intern at the Neurospin Parietal team, where I worked on methods decoding fMRI data and open software tools. 

I'm interested in the brain and how it performs computations, and I want to probe its functioning using mathematical modelling and machine learning methods.
